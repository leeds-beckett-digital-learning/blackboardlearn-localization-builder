	<!-- FIXES
	The prefix and suffix are added to every 'match' attribute value before they are used.
	They are designed to prevent matches with text in variable names and only text which
	will be user readable.
	-->

	<fixes prefix="(?&lt;![\.@a-zA-Z_{/])" suffix="(?![a-zA-Z_])"/>

	<!-- PROCESSING
	Choose is the element that contains the processing. Each string property
	will be passed through the processing one by one. The choose element has
	a series of one or more when elements followed by an otherwise element.
	The string property will be processed by the first when clause that matches
	or, if none match, by the otherwise clause. (It will only be processed by
	one clause.)
	-->

		<!-- ABOUT CLAUSES
		Early clauses catch a few niche strings that need special processing
		because they are not just changes in terminology but provide improved
		or more appropriate messages to users.
		-->

		<!-- The value for this single key needs to be changed entirely regardless of current value -->
		<!-- Note use of target="ultra" so this clause is ignored for classic strings. -->

			<matches part="key" spec="^welcome\.welcome\.title.*"/>

		<!-- The value for this single key needs to be changed entirely regardless of current value -->
		<when target="ultra">
			<matches part="key" spec="^welcome\.welcome\.description.*"/>
			<changes>
				<replace match=".*"  with="Your Portal and Virtual Learning Environment at --------- University."/>
			</changes>

		<!-- This clause processes three specific properties in Ultra to insert "MyBeckett"  
			Note that more strings will have MyBeckett inserted using the otherwise clause. -->
		
		<when target="ultra">
			<!-- Checks if key of the string property matches the regular expression in 'spec' -->

		<!-- This clause will only be used for ultra string properties
		<!-- This clause detects all the properties that should be ignored for various reasons
			and this doesn't have target="ultra" because these keys are in either classic or ultra.
		-->
		<when>
		
			<!-- Property names (index 0) that have 'xythosmetadata.' at the start -->
			<!-- This because the word organization does not refer to BB Learn orgs here -->
			<matches part="key" spec="^xythosmetadata\..*"/>
			<!-- Make no changes for these strings. In other words prevent processing these strings 
			using the otherwise clause. -->

				The order of these changes is significant.
				Plurals need to be replaced before singulars.
				If a 'with' attribute for one replace is the
				same as a 'match' for a different replace     
				it needs to be later in the list.             
				
				To protect a phrase that contains a word that   
				elsewhere needs changing, change the phrase into
				a unique nonsense phrase at the start and change
				back at the end.
